marketing-materials
===================

Things we as a community should have ready when representing Plone at a conference::

 * Case Studies hand out
 * Some way to indicate people who use Plone 
 * A revamped large poster that is targeting towards business folks
 * A separate large poster for developers, recommending the one used at europython
 * A stand that actually holds the poster we have
 * NO MORE STICKERS. People don't really want these. They don't know what plone is - why would they want a sticker?
 * A talking points sheet, which instructs people what message to send depending on what person they are talking to.   Include the answer to the oft asked question: so, what is plone? and my favorite for this conference "wait - how do you make money?"
 * schwag: 
1 Person specifically asked for a tshirt. Most people were hanging out mugs and things like that. We have no schwag that is sustainable and follows people. I'm not suggesting mugs, but we need some physical and persistent thing. One idea that was mentioned is USB sticks with a Plone demo on it. This would have to likely include a VM, and if they could be customized towards certain realms like education, government, intranet, or nonprofit, major win. 
 * Printed out list of US Plone providers. (or whatever country people are in)
 * Printed out list of people who use plone
 * a big poster in the background.

Ahead of time I ran around like crazy trying to find/print marketing materials. I will add them in another note fir future use. People grabbed the notecards the most, and I made sure to have sponsors on there which in the end was where I recommended people go if they wanted a support partner (generally, people were looking to hire a company, which made things AWKWARD cause I had no wares to sell).

People asked a lot about our support of channels, which is a word I saw a lot and yet really didn't understand. 

I ended up handing out all but 1 of the CMS garndeners summary, most of the candy (the rest went to support staff - I had empathy), and probably 30 postcards. I will keep the cards for the next event.

Some interesting tidbits:
People were less likely to approach me when I was standing and more likely if I just stared off into the distance looking bored. More likely to approach if I was already talking to someone else  (read: 2 people should be at a booth) and if I was drinking a mug of tea, not a cup.



Messaging
---------
The main issue with the audience is that they, as a majority, are only familiar with the surface level notion of open source. These are people who think that open source means they hire a company who has open code. Not a single person understood why a foundation was necessary and there was a lot of mistrust because they didn't believe that we "don't make money". Instead of getting warm fuzzies about stories of people volunteering to fix the code, people were actually quite uneasy. There was only 1 person I think that was like "wow that is so fascinating". He was awesome. 

The messages that struck chords with people (read: usually 1 person) were:
 * Internationalization, in specific, R to L capability
 * Security sometimes, but not as much as I thought. There was one guy from a jet propulsion laboratory who was totally into it. Everyone else was eyes glazed over.
 * The Brazil gov story. We seriously need a hand out just for that
 * Non-profit. 2 people gave me some serious sob stories. 

Points of confusion:
Open source is hard to understand for some - they sincerely didn't understand "where the money comes from".  I LOVE Eric Steeles quote about "while you are staring at shitty banners, I'm fixing code". That says it all. We should have tshirts for that. It's a great schtick. I think its a very interesting angle, and people remember it, if only because its mind blowing.
